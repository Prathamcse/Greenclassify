# GreenClassify — Vegetable Image Classification

**GreenClassify** is a deep learning project that classifies vegetable images into 15 categories using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and serves predictions through a Flask web application.

---

## Project Overview
- **Objective:** Build and deploy a model to automatically identify vegetable types from images (e.g., Broccoli, Carrot, Tomato).
- **Model:** Custom CNN (or ResNet feature extractor option) trained on a 15-class vegetable dataset.
- **Frontend:** Flask app with `index.html`, `prediction.html`, and `logout.html`.
- **Use cases:** Automated sorting, quality control, smart shelf management.
